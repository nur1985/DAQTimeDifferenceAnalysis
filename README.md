# DAQTimeDifferenceAnalysis

The scripts calculate the MINERVA and MINOS data acquisition time difference. The MINERvA time comes from an NTP timing server and MINOS time is synced with the MINOS Far Detector in Sudan via GPS. Since MINOS detector is immediately after MINERvA detector and has a magnet which is used to extract muon momentum information when a muon track goes through both MINERvA and MINOS. So it is extremely important to have a precise timing match between MINERvA and MINOS near detector in order to reconstruct a proper track and extract its momentum. This method monitors the live time difference between MINERvA and MINOS timing server and sends an automated notification to relevant experts with a report whenever there is a mismatch between them. It also produces plots for the last 24 hours for the shifter to report any inconsistency.
